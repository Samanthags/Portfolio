# Portfolio by Samantha GarciaSilva  *throws confetti*

Hello everyone! Thank you for checking out my portfolio :)
It was really fun to create these projects with my fellow collegues in the CUNY Techworks program and showcase them to you all. If you want to know more about the program this is the link to their site --> https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/contEd/CUNY-TechWorks.html . I will do my best to create more fun projects for everyone to see and put my all into becoming a Software Developer :D
